<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D1"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>The username should be just a username; instead we can see it’s a long line of text with an HTTP command in it. This is an example of a buffer overflow attack. A buffer overflow occurs when a program or process tries to store more data in a buffer (temporary data storage area) than it was intended to hold. Since buffers are created to contain a finite amount of data, the extra information – which has to go somewhere – can overflow into adjacent buffers, corrupting or overwriting the valid data held in them. Although it may occur accidentally through programming error, buffer overflow is an increasingly common type of security attack on data integrity. In buffer overflow attacks, the extra data may contain codes designed to trigger specific actions, in effect sending new instructions to the attacked computer that could, for example, damage the user’s files, change data, or disclose confidential information. Buffer overflow attacks are said to have arisen because the C programming language supplied the framework, and poor programming practices supplied the vulnerability. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D3"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>URL filtering, also known as web filtering, is the act of blocking access to a site based on all or part of the URL used to request access. URL filtering can focus on all or part of a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), specific path names, specific filenames, specific fi le extensions, or entire specific URLs. Many URL-filtering tools can obtain updated master URL block lists from vendors as well as allow administrators to add or remove URLs from a custom list. </p></span> </div>

<p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902D8').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D8"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Hardware-based encryption when built into the drive is transparent to the user. The drive except for bootup authentication operates just like any drive with no degradation in performance. When the computer is started up, the user is prompted to enter a password to allow the system to boot and allow access to the encrypted drive. When a laptop is placed into sleep mode (also known as standby mode), the computer is placed into a low power mode. In sleep mode, the computer is not fully shut down. The screen is turned off, the hard disks are turned off and the CPU is throttled down to its lowest power state. However, the computer state is maintained in memory (RAM). Most computers can be ‘woken’ from sleep mode by pressing any key on the keyboard or pressing the power button. The computer can be configured to require a password on wake up, but if a password is not required, the computer will wake up and be logged in as it was at the time of going into sleep mode. This would enable full access to the data stored on the disks. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D9"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Black-box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures or workings. This method of test can be applied to virtually every level of software testing: unit, integration, system and acceptance. It typically comprises most if not all higher level testing, but can also dominate unit testing as well. Specific knowledge of the application’s code/internal structure and programming knowledge in general is not required. The tester is aware of what the software is supposed to do but is not aware of how it does it. For instance, the tester is aware that a particular input returns a certain, invariable output but is not aware of how the software produces the output in the first place. </p></span> </div>

<style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>
<p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902D12').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D12"><span><b>Answer: A </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Gray box testing, also called gray box analysis, is a strategy for software debugging in which the tester has limited knowledge of the internal details of the program. A gray box is a device, program or system whose workings are partially understood. Gray box testing can be contrasted with black box testing, a scenario in which the tester has no knowledge or access to the internal workings of a program, or white box testing, a scenario in which the internal particulars are fully known. Gray box testing is commonly used in penetration tests. Gray box testing is considered to be non-intrusive and unbiased because it does not require that the tester have access to the source code. With respect to internal processes, gray box testing treats a program as a black box that must be analyzed from the outside. During a gray box test, the person may know how the system components interact but not have detailed knowledge about internal program functions and operation. A clear distinction exists between the developer and the tester, thereby minimizing the risk of personnel conflicts. </p></span> </div>

<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>a wildcard certificate is a public key certificate which can be used with multiple subdomains of a domain. In public-key cryptography, the receiver has a private key known only to them; a public key corresponds to it, which they make known to others. The public key can be sent to all other parties; the private key is never divulged. A symmetric algorithm requires that receivers of the message use the same private key.

<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A: PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) is part of PKCS #5 v. 2.01. It applies some function (like a hash or HMAC) to the password or passphrase along with Salt to produce a derived key. </p>
<p>D: bcrypt is a key derivation function for passwords based on the Blowfish cipher. Besides incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, bcrypt is an adaptive function: over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower, so it remains resistant to brute-force search attacks even with increasing computation power. The bcrypt function is the default password hash algorithm for BSD and many other systems. </p>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D27"><span><b>Answer: A </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Whaling is a specific kind of malicious hacking within the more general category of phishing, which involves hunting for data that can be used by the hacker. In general, phishing efforts are focused on collecting personal data about users. In whaling, the targets are high-ranking bankers, executives or others in powerful positions or job titles. Hackers who engage in whaling often describe these efforts as “reeling in a big fish,” applying a familiar metaphor to the process of scouring technologies for loopholes and opportunities for data theft. Those who are engaged in whaling may, for example, hack into specific networks where these powerful individuals work or store sensitive data. They may also set up keylogging or other malware on a work station associated with one of these executives. There are many ways that hackers can pursue whaling, leading C-level or top-level executives in business and government to stay vigilant about the possibility of cyber threats. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D29"><span><b>Answer: A </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A vulnerability scan is the process of scanning the network and/or I.T. infrastructure for threats and vulnerabilities. The threats and vulnerabilities are then evaluated in a risk assessment and the necessary actions taken to resolve and vulnerabilities. A vulnerability scan scans for known weaknesses such as missing patches or security updates. </p>
<p>A vulnerability scan is the automated process of proactively identifying security vulnerabilities of computing systems in a network in order to determine if and where a system can be exploited and/or threatened. While public servers are important for communication and data transfer over the Internet, they open the door to potential security breaches by threat agents, such as malicious hackers. Vulnerability scanning employs software that seeks out security flaws based on a database of known flaws, testing systems for the occurrence of these flaws and generating a report of the findings that an individual or an enterprise can use to tighten the network’s security. </p></span> </div>

<p>A. Packet <br/>B. Active <br/>C. Port <br/>D. Passive </p>
<style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>
<p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902D31').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D31"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>TCP/IP stack fingerprinting is the passive collection of configuration attributes from a remote device during standard layer 4 network communications. The combination of parameters may then be used to infer the remote machine’s operating system (aka, OS fingerprinting), or incorporated into a device fingerprint. </p>
<p>Certain parameters within the TCP protocol definition are left up to the implementation. Different operating systems and different versions of the same operating system set different defaults for these values. By collecting and examining these values, one may differentiate among various operating systems, and implementations of TCP/IP. Just inspecting the Initial TTL and window size TCP/IP fields is often enough in order to successfully identify an operating system, which eases the task of performing manual OS fingerprinting. </p>
<p>Passive OS fingerprinting is the examination of a passively collected sample of packets from a host in order to determine its operating system platform. It is called passive because it doesn’t involve communicating with the host being examined. In this question, the proxy will use passive fingerprinting because the proxy is a ‘transparent proxy’. It isn’t seen by the computer. </p></span> </div>

PII can also be exploited by criminals to stalk or steal the identity of a person, or to aid in the planning of criminal acts. Personally identifiable information (PII) is a catchall for any data that can be used to uniquely identify an individual.

<style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>
<p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902D46').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D46"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>When a password is “tried” against a system it is “hashed” using encryption so that the actual password is never sent in clear text across the communications line. This prevents eavesdroppers from intercepting the password. The hash of a password usually looks like a bunch of garbage and is typically a different length than the original password. Your password might be “shitzu” but the hash of your password would look something like “7378347eedbfdd761619451949225ec1”. To verify a user, a system takes the hash value created by the password hashing function on the client computer and compares it to the hash value stored in a table on the server. If the hashes match, then the user is authenticated and granted access. Password cracking programs work in a similar way to the login process. The cracking program starts by taking plaintext passwords, running them through a hash algorithm, such as MD5, and then compares the hash output with the hashes in the stolen password file. If it finds a match then the program has cracked the password. Rainbow Tables are basically huge sets of precomputed tables filled with hash values that are pre­matched to possible plaintext passwords. The Rainbow Tables essentially allow hackers to reverse the hashing function to determine what the plaintext password might be. The use of Rainbow Tables allow for passwords to be cracked in a very short amount of time compared with brute-force methods, however, the trade-off is that it takes a lot of storage (sometimes Terabytes) to hold the Rainbow Tables themselves. </p>
<p>With a rainbow table, all of the possible hashes are computed in advance. In other words, you create a series of tables; each has all the possible two-letter, three-letter, four-letter, and so forth combinations and the hash of that combination, using a known hashing algorithm like SHA-2. Now if you search the table for a given hash, the letter combination in the table that produced the hash must be the password you are seeking. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D54"><span><b>Answer: A,D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A: Take Hashes. NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology) maintains a National Software Reference Library (NSRL). One of the purposes of the NSRL is to collect “known, traceable software applications” through their hash values and store them in a Reference Data Set (RDS). The RDS can then be used by law enforcement, government agencies, and businesses to determine which fi les are important as evidence in criminal investigations. </p>
<p>D: A system image is a snapshot of what exists. Capturing an image of the operating system in its exploited state can be helpful in revisiting the issue after the fact to learn more about it. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D55"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a hardware-based encryption solution that is embedded in the system’s motherboard and is enabled or disable in BIOS. It helps with hash key generation and stores cryptographic keys, passwords, or certificates on non-volatile (NV) memory. Data stored on NV memory is retained unaltered when the device has no power. The storage root key is embedded in the TPM to protect TPM keys created by applications, so that these keys cannot be used without the TPM. </p></span> </div>

<p><b>A company has several conference rooms with wired network jacks that are used by both employees and guests. Employees need access to internal resources and guests only need access to the Internet. Which of the following combinations is BEST to meet the requirements? <br/></b></p>
<p>A. NAT and DMZ <br/>B. VPN and IPSec <br/>C. Switches and a firewall <br/>D. 802.1x and VLANs </p>
<style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>
<p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902D58').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D58"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>802.1x is a port-based authentication mechanism. It’s based on Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) and is commonly used in closed-environment wireless networks. 802.1x was initially used to compensate for the weaknesses of Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), but today it’s often used as a component in more complex authentication and connection-management systems, including Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS), Diameter, Cisco System’s Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+), and Network Access Control (NAC). </p>
<p>A virtual local area network (VLAN) is a hardware-imposed network segmentation created by switches. By default, all ports on a switch are part of VLAN 1. But as the switch administrator changes the VLAN assignment on a port-by-port basis, various ports can be grouped together and be distinct from other VLAN port designations. VLANs are used for traffic management. Communications between ports within the same VLAN occur without hindrance, but communications between VLANs require a routing function. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D59"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Cross-Site Request Forgery—also known as XSRF, session riding, and one-click attack—involves unauthorized commands coming from a trusted user to the website. This is often done without the user’s knowledge, and it employs some type of social networking to pull it off. For example, assume that Evan and Spencer are chatting through Facebook. Spencer sends Evan a link to what he purports is a funny video that will crack him up. Evan clicks the link, but it actually brings up Evan’s bank account information in another browser tab, takes a screenshot of it, closes the tab, and sends the information to Spencer. The reason the attack is possible is because Evan is a trusted user with his own bank. In order for it to work, Evan would need to have recently accessed that bank’s website and have a cookie that had yet to expire. The best protection against cross-site scripting is to disable the running of scripts (and browser profi les). </p></span> </div>

<p>A. Hoax <br/>B. Phishing <br/>C. Vishing <br/>D. Whaling </p>
<style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>
<p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902D63').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D63"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Vishing (voice or VoIP phishing) is an electronic fraud tactic in which individuals are tricked into revealing critical financial or personal information to unauthorized entities. Vishing works like phishing but does not always occur over the Internet and is carried out using voice technology. A vishing attack can be conducted by voice email, VoIP (voice over IP), or landline or cellular telephone. The potential victim receives a message, often generated by speech synthesis, indicating that suspicious activity has taken place in a credit card account, bank account, mortgage account or other financial service in their name. The victim is told to call a specific telephone number and provide information to “verify identity” or to “ensure that fraud does not occur.” If the attack is carried out by telephone, caller ID spoofing can cause the victim’s set to indicate a legitimate source, such as a bank or a government agency. </p>
<p>Vishing is difficult for authorities to trace, particularly when conducted using VoIP. Furthermore, like many legitimate customer services, vishing scams are often outsourced to other countries, which may render sovereign law enforcement powerless. </p>
<p>Consumers can protect themselves by suspecting any unsolicited message that suggests they are targets of illegal activity, no matter what the medium or apparent source. Rather than calling a number given in any unsolicited message, a consumer should directly call the institution named, using a number that is known to be valid, to verify all recent activity and to ensure that the account information has not been tampered with. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D68"><span><b>Answer: A </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>The question states that the building has three wireless networks. However, the scan is showing four wireless networks with the SSIDs: Computer AreUs1 , Computer AreUs2 , Computer AreUs3 and Computer AreUs4. Therefore, one of these wireless networks probably shouldn’t be there. This is an example of a rogue access point. A rogue access point is a wireless access point that has either been installed on a secure company network without explicit authorization from a local network administrator, or has been created to allow a hacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack. Rogue access points of the first kind can pose a security threat to large organizations with many employees, because anyone with access to the premises can install (maliciously or non-maliciously) an inexpensive wireless router that can potentially allow access to a secure network to unauthorized parties. Rogue access points of the second kind target networks that do not employ mutual authentication (client-server server-client) and may be used in conjunction with a rogue RADIUS server, depending on security configuration of the target network. To prevent the installation of rogue access points, organizations can install wireless intrusion prevention systems to monitor the radio spectrum for unauthorized access points. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D76"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>The question states that the ‘attack’ took place on public transport and was received on a smartphone. Therefore, it is most likely that the image was sent using Bluetooth. Bluejacking is the sending of unsolicited messages over Bluetooth to Bluetooth-enabled devices such as mobile phones, PDAs or laptop computers, sending a vCard which typically contains a message in the name field (i.e., for bluedating or bluechat) to another Bluetooth-enabled device via the OBEX protocol. Bluetooth has a very limited range, usually around 10 metres (32.8 ft) on mobile phones, but laptops can reach up to 100 metres (328 ft) with powerful (Class 1) transmitters. Bluejacking is usually harmless, but because bluejacked people generally don’t know what has happened, they may think that their phone is malfunctioning.

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D78"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A vulnerability scan is the process of scanning the network and/or I.T. infrastructure for threats and vulnerabilities. The threats and vulnerabilities are then evaluated in a risk assessment and the necessary actions taken to resolve and vulnerabilities. A vulnerability scan scans for known weaknesses such as missing patches or security updates. </p>
<p>A vulnerability scan is the automated process of proactively identifying security vulnerabilities of computing systems in a network in order to determine if and where a system can be exploited and/or threatened. While public servers are important for communication and data transfer over the Internet, they open the door to potential security breaches by threat agents, such as malicious hackers. Vulnerability scanning employs software that seeks out security flaws based on a database of known flaws, testing systems for the occurrence of these flaws and generating a report of the findings that an individual or an enterprise can use to tighten the network’s security. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D79"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>In this question, the attacker has created another wireless network that is impersonating one of more of the three wireless networks listed in the question. This is known as an Evil Twin. An evil twin, in the context of network security, is a rogue or fake wireless access point (WAP) that appears as a genuine hotspot offered by a legitimate provider. In an evil twin attack, an eavesdropper or hacker fraudulently creates this rogue hotspot to collect the personal data of unsuspecting users. Sensitive data can be stolen by spying on a connection or using a phishing technique. For example, a hacker using an evil twin exploit may be positioned near an authentic Wi-Fi access point and discover the service set identifier (SSID) and frequency. The hacker may then send a radio signal using the exact same frequency and SSID. To end users, the rogue evil twin appears as their legitimate hotspot with the same name. In wireless transmissions, evil twins are not a new phenomenon. Historically, they were known as honeypots or base station clones. With the advancement of wireless technology and the use of wireless devices in public areas, it is very easy for novice users to set up evil twin exploits. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D80"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>The basic process of Kerberos authentication is as follows: The subject provides logon credentials. </p>
<p>The Kerberos client system encrypts the password and transmits the protected credentials to the KDC. The KDC verifies the credentials and then creates a ticket-granting ticket (TGT—a hashed form of the subject’s password with the addition of a time stamp that indicates a valid lifetime). The TGT is encrypted and sent to the client. The client receives the TGT. At this point, the subject is an authenticated principle in the Kerberos realm. The subject requests access to resources on a network server. This causes the client to request a service ticket (ST) from the KDC. The KDC verifies that the client has a valid TGT and then issues an ST to the client. The ST includes a time stamp that indicates its valid lifetime. The client receives the ST. The client sends the ST to the network server that hosts the desired resource. The network server verifies the ST. If it’s verified, it initiates a communication session with the client. From this point forward, Kerberos is no longer involved. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D81"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Penetration testing (also called pen testing) is the practice of testing a computer system, network or Web application to find vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit. Pen tests can be automated with software applications or they can be performed manually. Either way, the process includes gathering information about the target before the test (reconnaissance), identifying possible entry points, attempting to break in (either virtually or for real) and reporting </p>
<p>back the findings. The main objective of penetration testing is to determine security weaknesses. A pen test can also be used to test an organization’s security policy compliance, its employees’ security awareness and the organization’s ability to identify and respond to security incidents. Penetration tests are sometimes called white hat attacks because in a pen test, the good guys are attempting to break in. </p>
<p>Pen test strategies include: </p>
<p>Targeted testing Targeted testing is performed by the organization’s IT team and the penetration testing team working together. It’s sometimes referred to as a “lights-turned-on” approach because everyone can see the test being carried out. </p>
<p>External testing This type of pen test targets a company’s externally visible servers or devices including domain name servers (DNS), e-mail servers, Web servers or firewalls. The objective is to find out if an outside attacker can get in and how far they can get in once they’ve gained access. </p>
<p>Internal testing This test mimics an inside attack behind the firewall by an authorized user with standard access privileges. This kind of test is useful for estimating how much damage a disgruntled employee could cause. </p>
<p>Blind testing A blind test strategy simulates the actions and procedures of a real attacker by severely limiting the information given to the person or team that’s performing the test beforehand. Typically, they may only be given the name of the company. Because this type of test can require a considerable amount of time for reconnaissance, it can be expensive. </p>
<p>Double blind testing Double blind testing takes the blind test and carries it a step further. In this type of pen test, only one or two people within the organization might be aware a test is being conducted. Double-blind tests can be useful for testing an organization’s security monitoring and incident identification as well as its response procedures. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D91"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>MAC filtering is typically used in wireless networks. In computer networking, MAC Filtering (or GUI filtering, or layer 2 address filtering) refers to a security access control method whereby the 48-bit address assigned to each network card is used to determine access to the network. MAC addresses are uniquely assigned to each card, so using MAC filtering on a network permits and denies network access to specific devices through the use of blacklists and whitelists. While the restriction of network access through the use of lists is straightforward, an individual person is not identified by a MAC address, rather a device only, so an authorized person will need to have a whitelist entry for each device that he or she would use to access the network. While giving a wireless network some additional protection, MAC filtering can be circumvented by scanning a valid MAC (via airodumping) and then spoofing one’s own MAC into a validated one. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D93"><span><b>Answer: A,E </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Peter wants to send a message to Ann. It’s important that this message not be altered. Peter will use the private key to create a digital signature. The message is, in effect, signed with the private key. Peter then sends the message to Ann. Ann will use the public key attached to the message to validate the digital signature. If the values match, Ann knows the message is authentic and came from Peter. Ann will use a key provided by Peter—the public key—to decrypt the message. Most digital signature implementations also use a hash to verify that the message has not been altered, intentionally or accidently, in transit. Thus Ann would compare the signature area referred to as a message in the message with the calculated value digest (her private key in this case). If the values match, the message hasn’t been tampered with and the originator is verified as the person they claim to be. This process provides message integrity, nonrepudiation, and authentication. A certificate authority (CA) is an organization that is responsible for issuing, revoking, and distributing certificates. A certificate is nothing more than a mechanism that associates the public key with an individual. If Peter wants to send Ann an encrypted e-mail, there should be a mechanism to verify to Ann that the message received from Mike is really from Peter. If a third party (the CA) vouches for Peter and Ann trusts that third party, Ann can assume that the message is authentic because the third party says so. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D96"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>An authentication ticket, also known as a ticket-granting ticket (TGT), is a small amount of encrypted data that is issued by a server in the Kerberos authentication model to begin the authentication process. When the client receives an authentication ticket, the client sends the ticket back to the server along with additional information verifying the client’s identity. The server then issues a service ticket and a session key (which includes a form of password), completing the authorization process for that session. In the Kerberos model, all tickets are time-stamped and have limited lifetimes. This minimizes the danger that hackers will be able to steal or crack the encrypted data and use it to compromise the system. Ideally, no authentication ticket remains valid for longer than the time an expert hacker would need to crack the encryption. Authentication tickets are session-specific, further improving the security of the system by ensuring that no authentication ticket remains valid after a given session is complete. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902D100"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A botnet is a collection of Internet-connected programs communicating with other similar programs in order to perform tasks. This can be as mundane as keeping control of an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel, or it could be used to send spam email or participate in distributed denial-of-service attacks. The word botnet is a combination of the words robot and network. The term is usually used with a negative or malicious connotation. Computers can be co-opted into a botnet when they execute malicious software. This can be accomplished by luring users into making a drive-by download, exploiting web browser vulnerabilities, or by tricking the user into running a Trojan horse program, which may come from an email attachment. This malware will typically install modules that allow the computer to be commanded and controlled by the botnet’s operator. Many computer users are unaware that their computer is infected with bots. Depending on how it is written, a Trojan may then delete itself, or may remain present to update and maintain the modules. </p></span> </div>
