<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A13"><span><b>Answer: C,D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Network administrators may choose to disable SSID broadcast to hide their network from unauthorized personnel. However, the SSID is still needed to direct packets to and from the base station, so it’s a discoverable value using a wireless packet sniffer. Thus, the SSID should be disabled if the network isn’t for public use. A MAC filter is a list of authorized wireless client interface MAC addresses that is used by a WAP to block access to all unauthorized devices. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A14"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>If MAC filtering is turned off, any wireless client that knows the values looked for (MAC addresses) can join the network. When MAC filtering is used, the administrator compiles a list of the MAC addresses associated with users’ computers and enters those addresses. When a client attempts to connect and other values have been correctly entered, an additional check of the MAC address is done. If the address appears in the list, the client is allowed to join; otherwise, it is forbidden from doing so. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A16"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Port security in IT can mean several things. It can mean the physical control of all connection points, such as RJ-45 wall jacks or device ports, so that no unauthorized users or unauthorized devices can attempt to connect into an open port. This can be accomplished by locking down the wiring closet and server vaults and then disconnecting the workstation run from the patch panel (or punch-down block) that leads to a room’s wall jack. Any unneeded or unused wall jacks can (and should) be physically disabled in this manner. Another option is to use a smart patch panel that can monitor the MAC address of any device connected to each and every wall port across a building and detect not just when a new device is connected to an empty port, but also when a valid device is disconnected or replaced by an invalid device. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A33"><span><b>Answer: A,B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A: External emergency communications that should fit into your business continuity plan include notifying family members of an injury or death, discussing the disaster with the media, and providing status information to key clients and stakeholders. Each message needs to be prepared with the audience (e.g., employees, media, families, government regulators) in mind; broad general announcements may be acceptable in the initial aftermath of an incident, but these will need to be tailored to the audiences in subsequent releases. </p>
<p>B: A typical emergency communications plan should be extensive in detail and properly planned by a business continuity planner. Internal alerts are sent using either email, overhead building paging systems, voice messages or text messages to cell/smartphones with instructions to evacuate the building and relocate at assembly points, updates on the status of the situation, and notification of when it’s safe to return to work. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A34"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Looking at information on a computer screen without the computer user’s knowledge is known as shoulder surfing. Shoulder surfing is using direct observation techniques, such as looking over someone’s shoulder, to get information. Shoulder surfing is an effective way to get information in crowded places because it’s relatively easy to stand next to someone and watch as they fill out a form, enter a PIN number at an ATM machine, or use a calling card at a public pay phone. Shoulder surfing can also be done long distance with the aid of binoculars or other vision-enhancing devices. To prevent shoulder surfing, experts recommend that you shield paperwork or your keypad from view by using your body or cupping your hand. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A36"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Port Address Translation (PAT), is an extension to network address translation (NAT) that permits multiple devices on a local area network (LAN) to be mapped to a single public IP address. The goal of PAT is to conserve IP addresses. </p>
<p>Most home networks use PAT. In such a scenario, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) assigns a single IP address to the home network’s router. When Computer X logs on the Internet, the router assigns the client a port number, which is appended to the internal IP address. This, in effect, gives Computer X a unique address. If Computer Z logs on the Internet at the same time, the router assigns it the same local IP address with a different port number. Although both computers are sharing the same public IP address and accessing the Internet at the same time, the router knows exactly which computer to send specific packets to because each computer has a unique internal address. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A37"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A buffer overflow occurs when a program or process tries to store more data in a buffer (temporary data storage area) than it was intended to hold. Since buffers are created to contain a finite amount of data, the extra information – which has to go somewhere – can overflow into adjacent buffers, corrupting or overwriting the valid data held in them. Although it may occur accidentally through programming error, buffer overflow is an increasingly common type of security attack on data integrity. In buffer overflow attacks, the extra data may contain codes designed to trigger specific actions, in effect sending new instructions to the attacked computer that could, for example, damage the user’s files, change data, or disclose confidential information. Buffer overflow attacks are said to have arisen because the C programming language supplied the framework, and poor programming practices supplied the vulnerability. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A39"><span><b>Answer: A </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Intrusion prevention systems (IPS), also known as intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), are network security appliances that monitor network and/or system activities for malicious activity. The main functions of intrusion prevention systems are to identify malicious activity, log information about this activity, attempt to block/stop it, and report it. </p>
<p>Intrusion prevention systems are considered extensions of intrusion detection systems because they both monitor network traffic and/or system activities for malicious activity. The main differences are, unlike intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems are placed in-line and are able to actively prevent/block intrusions that are detected. More specifically, IPS can take such actions as sending an alarm, dropping the malicious packets, resetting the connection and/or blocking the traffic from the offending IP address. An IPS can also correct Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) errors, unfragment packet streams, prevent TCP sequencing issues, and clean up unwanted transport and network layer options. Host-based intrusion prevention system (HIPS) is an installed software package which monitors a single host for suspicious activity by analyzing events occurring within that host. A Host-based intrusion prevention system (HIPS) is an installed software package which monitors a single host for suspicious activity by analyzing events occurring within that host. As a zero-day attack is an unknown vulnerability (a vulnerability that does not have a fix or a patch to prevent it), the best defence would be an intrusion prevention system. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A40"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>This is an example of an online hybrid attack. A hybrid attack is a combination of attacks. In this example, we have a combination of a dictionary attack and a brute-force attack. A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as a user password or personal identification number (PIN). In a brute force attack, automated software is used to generate a large number of consecutive guesses as to the value of the desired data. A dictionary attack uses a list of words to use as passwords. The combination or hybrid attack adds characters or numbers or even other words to the beginning or end of the password guesses. In this example we have a password guess of ‘admin’. From the word admin, we have four combinations, ‘admin1, 1admin, admin2, 2admin’. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A53"><span><b>Answer: B,D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>B: If an employee leaves and we need access to data he has encrypted, we can use the key recovery agent to retrieve his decryption key. We can use this recovered key to access the data. A key recovery agent is an entity that has the ability to recover a key, key components, or plaintext messages as needed. As opposed to escrow, recovery agents are typically used to access information that is encrypted with older keys. </p>
<p>D: If a key need to be recovered for legal purposes the key escrow can be used. Key escrow addresses the possibility that a third party may need to access keys. Under the conditions of key escrow, the keys needed to encrypt/decrypt data are held in an escrow account (think of the term as it relates to home mortgages) and made available if that third party requests them. The third party in question is generally the government, but it could also be an employer if an employee’s private messages have been called into question. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A60"><span><b>Answer: A </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Configuring the switch to allow only traffic from computers based upon their physical address is known as MAC filtering. The physical address is known as the MAC address. Every network adapter has a unique MAC address hardcoded into the adapter. You can configure the ports of a switch to allow connections from computers with specific MAC addresses only and block all other MAC addresses. In computer networking, MAC Filtering (or GUI filtering, or layer 2 address filtering) refers to a security access control method whereby the 48-bit address assigned to each network card is used to determine access to the network. MAC addresses are uniquely assigned to each card, so using MAC filtering on a network permits and denies network access to specific devices through the use of blacklists and whitelists. While the restriction of network access through the use of lists is straightforward, an individual person is not identified by a MAC address, rather a device only, so an authorized person will need to have a whitelist entry for each device that he or she would use to access the network. </p></span> </div>

    <div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A68"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A directory service is accessed by using LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol). LDAP injection is an attack against a directory service. Just as SQL injection attacks take statements that are input by users and exploit weaknesses within, an LDAP injection attack exploits weaknesses in LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) implementations. This can occur when the user’s input is not properly filtered, and the result can be executed commands, modified content, or results returned to unauthorized queries. The best way to prevent LDAP injection attacks is to filter the user input and to use a validation scheme to make certain that queries do not contain exploits. One of the most common uses of LDAP is associated with user information. Numerous applications exist—such as employee directories—where users find other users by typing in a portion of their name. These queries are looking at the cn value or other fields (those defined for department, home directory, and so on). Someone attempting LDAP injection could feed unexpected values to the query to see what results are returned. All too often, finding employee information equates to finding usernames and values about those users that could be portions of their passwords. </p></span> </div>

    <div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A69"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>In this question, we need to determine the public-facing network attack surface. We therefore need to perform a vulnerability scan from outside the network; in other words, an external vulnerability scan. A vulnerability scan is the automated process of proactively identifying security vulnerabilities of computing systems in a network in order to determine if and where a system can be exploited and/or threatened. While public servers are important for communication and data transfer over the Internet, they open the door to potential security breaches by threat agents, such as malicious hackers. Vulnerability scanning employs software that seeks out security flaws based on a database of known flaws, testing systems for the occurrence of these flaws and generating a report of the findings that an individual or an enterprise can use to tighten the network’s security. Vulnerability scanning typically refers to the scanning of systems that are connected to the Internet but can also refer to system audits on internal networks that are not connected to the Internet in order to assess the threat of rogue software or malicious employees in an enterprise. </p></span> </div>

    <div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A70"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>When the user opens an attachment, the attachment is loaded into memory. The error is caused by a memory issue due to a buffer overflow attack. </p>
    <p>A buffer overflow occurs when a program or process tries to store more data in a buffer (temporary data storage area) than it was intended to hold. Since buffers are created to contain a finite amount of data, the extra information – which has to go somewhere – can overflow into adjacent buffers, corrupting or overwriting the valid data held in them. Although it may occur accidentally through programming error, buffer overflow is an increasingly common type of security attack on data integrity. In buffer overflow attacks, the extra data may contain codes designed to trigger specific actions, in effect sending new instructions to the attacked computer that could, for example, damage the user’s files, change data, or disclose confidential information. Buffer overflow attacks are said to have arisen because the C programming language supplied the framework, and poor programming practices supplied the vulnerability. </p></span> </div>

    <div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A73"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>ARP spoofing is a type of attack in which a malicious actor sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local area network. This results in the linking of an attacker’s MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. Once the attacker’s MAC address is connected to an authentic IP address, the attacker will begin receiving any data that is intended for that IP address. ARP spoofing can enable malicious parties to intercept, modify or even stop data in-transit. ARP spoofing attacks can only occur on local area networks that utilize the Address Resolution Protocol. To perform ARP spoofing the attacker floods the network with spoofed ARP packets. As other hosts on the LAN cache the spoofed ARP packets, data that those hosts send to the victim will go to the attacker instead. From here, the attacker can steal data or launch a more sophisticated follow-up attack. </p>
    <p>A flood guard configured on the network switch will block the flood of spoofed ARP packets. </p></span> </div>

    <div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A79"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Continuous monitoring may involve regular measurements of network traffic levels, routine evaluations for regulatory compliance, and checks of network security device configurations. It also points toward the never-ending review of what resources a user actually accesses, which is critical for preventing insider threats. </p>
    <p>Incorrect Options: </p>
    <p>A: An initial baseline configuration snapshot would allow for the standardized minimal level of security that all systems in an organization must comply with to be enforced. This will not cover the non-technical security incidents. </p>
    <p>B: A Firewall, IPS and network segmentation will offer technical protection, but not non-technical security protection. </p>
    <p>C: Event log analysis and incident response will not cover the non-technical security incidents. </p>

    <div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A80"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>This question states that antivirus is up-to-date on the workstation and the firewall has not been altered. The antivirus software is up to date with all ‘known’ viruses. A zero day vulnerability is an unknown vulnerability so a patch or virus definition has not been released yet. </p>
    <p>A zero day vulnerability refers to a hole in software that is unknown to the vendor. This security hole is then exploited by hackers before the vendor becomes aware and hurries to fix it—this exploit is called a zero day attack. Uses of zero day attacks can include infiltrating malware, spyware or allowing unwanted access to user information. The term “zero day” refers to the unknown nature of the hole to those outside of the hackers, specifically, the developers. Once the vulnerability becomes known, a race begins for the developer, who must protect users. </p></span> </div>

    <p><b>During a security assessment, an administrator wishes to see which services are running on a remote server. Which of the following should the administrator use? <br/></b></p>
    <p>A. Port scanner <br/>B. Network sniffer <br/>C. Protocol analyzer <br/>D. Process list </p>
    <style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>

    <div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A82"><span><b>Answer: A </b>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Different services use different ports. When a service is enabled on a computer, a network port is opened for that service. For example, enabling the HTTP service on a web server will open port 80 on the server. By determining which ports are open on a remote server, we can determine which services are running on that server. A port scanner is a software application designed to probe a server or host for open ports. This is often used by administrators to verify security policies of their networks and by attackers to identify running services on a host with the view to compromise it. A port scan or portscan can be defined as a process that sends client requests to a range of server port addresses on a host, with the goal of finding an active port. While not a nefarious process in and of itself, it is one used by hackers to probe target machine services with the aim of exploiting a known vulnerability of that service. However the majority of uses of a port scan are not attacks and are simple probes to determine services available on a remote machine. </p></span> </div>

    <div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A83"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A vulnerability scan is the process of scanning the network and/or I.T. infrastructure for threats and vulnerabilities. The threats and vulnerabilities are then evaluated in a risk assessment and the necessary actions taken to resolve and vulnerabilities. A vulnerability scan scans for known weaknesses such as missing patches or security updates. </p>
    <p>A vulnerability scan is the automated process of proactively identifying security vulnerabilities of computing systems in a network in order to determine if and where a system can be exploited and/or threatened. While public servers are important for communication and data transfer over the Internet, they open the door to potential security breaches by threat agents, such as malicious hackers. Vulnerability scanning employs software that seeks out security flaws based on a database of known flaws, testing systems for the occurrence of these flaws and generating a report of the findings that an individual or an enterprise can use to tighten the network’s security. </p></span> </div>

    <style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>
    <p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902A90').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
    <div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902A90"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>WEP offers no end-to-end TLS encryption. </p>
    <p>The WEP process consists of a series of steps as follows: The wireless client sends an authentication request. The Access Point (AP) sends an authentication response containing clear-text (uh-oh!) challenge text. The client takes the challenge text received and encrypts it using a static WEP key. The client sends the encrypted authentication packet to the AP. The AP encrypts the challenge text using its own static WEP key and compares the result to the authentication packet sent by the client. If the results match, the AP begins the association process for the wireless client. </p>
    <p>The big issue with WEP is the fact that it is very susceptible to a Man in the Middle attack. The attacker captures the clear-text challenge and then the authentication packet reply. The attacker then reverses the RC4 encryption in order to derive the static WEP key. Yikes! As you might guess, the designers attempted to strengthen WEP using the approach of key lengths. The native Windows client supported a 104-bit key as opposed to the initial 40-bit key. The fundamental weaknesses in the WEP process still remained however. </p></span> </div>
