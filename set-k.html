<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902K1"><span><b>Answer: A </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is used to establish a secure communication connection between two TCP-based machines. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a security protocol that expands upon SSL. Many industry analysts predict that TLS will replace SSL in the future. TLS 1.0 was first defined in RFC 2246 in January 1999 as an upgrade of SSL Version 3.0. As of February 2015, the latest versions of all major web browsers support TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2, have them enabled by default. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902K3"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>This question describes a buffer overflow attack. </p>
<p>A buffer overflow occurs when a program or process tries to store more data in a buffer (temporary data storage area) than it was intended to hold. Since buffers are created to contain a finite amount of data, the extra information – which has to go somewhere – can overflow into adjacent buffers, corrupting or overwriting the valid data held in them. Although it may occur accidentally through programming error, buffer overflow is an increasingly common type of security attack on data integrity. In buffer overflow attacks, the extra data may contain codes designed to trigger specific actions, in effect sending new instructions to the attacked computer that could, for example, damage the user’s files, change data, or disclose confidential information. Buffer overflow attacks are said to have arisen because the C programming language supplied the framework, and poor programming practices supplied the vulnerability. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902K5"><span><b>Answer: A </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>In this scenario, we would use a honeypot as a ‘trap’ to catch unauthorized employees who are accessing critical project information. A honeypot is a system whose purpose it is to be attacked. An administrator can watch and study the attack to research current attack methodologies. </p>
<p>According to the Wepopedia.com, a Honeypot luring a hacker into a system has several main purposes: </p>
<p>The administrator can watch the hacker exploit the vulnerabilities of the system, thereby learning where the system has weaknesses that need to be redesigned. The hacker can be caught and stopped while trying to obtain root access to the system. By studying the activities of hackers, designers can better create more secure systems that are potentially invulnerable to future hackers. </p>
<p>There are two main types of honeypots: Production – A production honeypot is one used within an organization’s environment to help mitigate risk. Research – A research honeypot add value to research in computer security by providing a platform to study the threat. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902K6"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Hashing refers to the hash algorithms used in cryptography. It is used to store data, such as hash tables. One main characteristic of hashing is that the algorithm must have few or no collisions – in hashing two different inputs does not give the same output. Thus the credential fields should be hashed because anyone customer will have a unique credit card number/identity and since they will use their credit cards for many different transactions, the credit card field should be encrypted only, not hashed. </p></span> </div>

<p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902K7').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902K7"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A bluejacking attack is where unsolicited messages are sent to mobile devices using Bluetooth. Bluejacking is the sending of unsolicited messages over Bluetooth to Bluetooth-enabled devices such as mobile phones, PDAs or laptop computers, sending a vCard which typically contains a message in the name field (i.e., for bluedating or bluechat) to another Bluetooth-enabled device via the OBEX protocol. Bluetooth has a very limited range, usually around 10 metres (32.8 ft) on mobile phones, but laptops can reach up to 100 metres (328 ft) with powerful (Class 1) transmitters. Bluejacking is usually harmless, but because bluejacked people generally don’t know what has happened, they may think that their phone is malfunctioning. Usually, a bluejacker will only send a text message, but with modern phones it’s possible to send images or sounds as well. Bluejacking has been used in guerrilla marketing campaigns to promote advergames. </p></span> </div>

<p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902K9').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902K9"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>The mean time between failures (MTBF) is the measure of the anticipated incidence of failure for a system or component. This measurement determines the component’s anticipated lifetime. If the MTBF of a cooling system is one year, you can anticipate that the system will last for a one-year period; this means that you should be prepared to replace or rebuild the system once a year. If the system lasts longer than the MTBF, your organization receives a bonus. MTBF is helpful in evaluating a system’s reliability and life expectancy. Thus longer MTBF due to lower operating temperatures is a definite advantage </p></span> </div>

<p><b>Jane, an individual, has recently been calling various financial offices pretending to be another person to gain financial information. Which of the following attacks is being described? <br/></b></p>
<p>A. Phishing <br/>B. Tailgating <br/>C. Pharming <br/>D. Vishing </p>
<style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>
<p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902K11').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902K11"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Vishing (voice or VoIP phishing) is an electronic fraud tactic in which individuals are tricked into revealing critical financial or personal information to unauthorized entities. Vishing works like phishing but does not always occur over the Internet and is carried out using voice technology. A vishing attack can be conducted by voice email, VoIP (voice over IP), or landline or cellular telephone. The potential victim receives a message, often generated by speech synthesis, indicating that suspicious activity has taken place in a credit card account, bank account, mortgage account or other financial service in their name. The victim is told to call a specific telephone number and provide information to “verify identity” or to “ensure that fraud does not occur.” If the attack is carried out by telephone, caller ID spoofing can cause the victim’s set to indicate a legitimate source, such as a bank or a government agency. </p>
<p>Vishing is difficult for authorities to trace, particularly when conducted using VoIP. Furthermore, like many legitimate customer services, vishing scams are often outsourced to other countries, which may render sovereign law enforcement powerless. </p>
<p>Consumers can protect themselves by suspecting any unsolicited message that suggests they are targets of illegal activity, no matter what the medium or apparent source. Rather than calling a number given in any unsolicited message, a consumer should directly call the institution named, using a number that is known to be valid, to verify all recent activity and to ensure that the account information has not been tampered with. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902K13"><span><b>Answer: B,D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Humidity control prevents the buildup of static electricity in the environment. If the humidity drops much below 50 percent, electronic components are extremely vulnerable to damage from electrostatic shock. Most environmental systems also regulate humidity; however, a malfunctioning system can cause the humidity to be almost entirely extracted from a room. Make sure that environmental systems are regularly serviced. Electrostatic damage can occur when humidity levels get too low. Condensation is a direct result from failed humidity levels. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902K14"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>CCMP is the standard encryption protocol for use with the WPA2 standard and is much more secure than the WEP protocol and TKIP protocol of WPA. CCMP provides the following security services: Data confidentiality; ensures only authorized parties can access the information Authentication; provides proof of genuineness of the user Access control in conjunction with layer management </p>
<p>Incorrect Options: </p>
<p>A: The antenna type deals with signal strength and direction. It will not have a bearing on whether technology is older. </p>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902K17"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Wireless Access Points can be configured to use a channel. If you have multiple access points within range of each other, you should configure the access points to use different channels. Different channels use different frequencies. If you have two access points using the same channel, their Wi-Fi signals will interfere with each other. The question states that that many users are having difficulty connecting to the company’s wireless network. This is probably due to the signal being weakened by interference from another access point using the same channel. When the administrator takes a new laptop and physically goes to the access point and connects with no problems, he is able to connect because he is near the access point and therefore has a strong signal. </p></span> </div>

<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>The <script> </script> tags indicate that script is being inserted. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in Web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side script into Web pages viewed by other users. Cross-site scripting uses known vulnerabilities in web-based applications, their servers, or plug-in systems on which they rely. Exploiting one of these, attackers fold malicious content into the content being delivered from the compromised site. When the resulting combined content arrives at the client-side web browser, it has all been delivered from the trusted source, and thus operates under the permissions granted to that system. By finding ways of injecting malicious scripts into web pages, an attacker can gain elevated access-privileges to sensitive page content, session cookies, and a variety of other information maintained by the browser on behalf of the user. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902K36"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Phishing is the act of sending an email to a user falsely claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to scam the user into surrendering private information that will be used for identity theft. Phishing email will direct the user to visit a website where they are asked to update personal information, such as a password, credit card, social security, or bank account numbers, that the legitimate organization already has. The website, however, is bogus and set up only to steal the information the user enters on the page. Phishing emails are blindly sent to thousands, if not millions of recipients. By spamming large groups of people, the “phisher” counts on the email being read by a percentage of people who actually have an account with the legitimate company being spoofed in the email and corresponding webpage. Phishing, also referred to as brand spoofing or carding, is a variation on “fishing,” the idea being that bait is thrown out with the hopes that while most will ignore the bait, some will be tempted into biting. </p></span> </div>

<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A proxy is a device that acts on behalf of other(s). A commonly used proxy in computer networks is a web proxy. Web proxy functionality is often combined into a proxy firewall. </p>
<p>A proxy firewall can be thought of as an intermediary between your network and any other network. Proxy firewalls are used to process requests from an outside network; the proxy firewall examines the data and makes rule-based decisions about whether the request should be forwarded or refused. The proxy intercepts all of the packets and reprocesses them for use internally. This process includes hiding IP addresses. The proxy firewall provides better security than packet filtering because of the increased intelligence that a proxy firewall offers. Requests from internal network users are routed through the proxy. The proxy, in turn, repackages the request and sends it along, thereby isolating the user from the external network. The proxy can also offer caching, should the same request be made again, and it can increase the efficiency of data delivery. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902K63"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>PKI is a two-key, asymmetric system with four main components: certificate authority (CA), registration authority (RA), RSA (the encryption algorithm), and digital certificates. In typical public key infrastructure (PKI) arrangements, a digital signature from a certificate authority (CA) attests that a particular public key certificate is valid (i.e., contains correct information). Users, or their software on their behalf, check that the private key used to sign some certificate matches the public key in the CA’s certificate. Since CA certificates are often signed by other, “higher-ranking,” CAs, there must necessarily be a highest CA, which provides the ultimate in attestation authority in that particular PKI scheme. Localhost is a hostname that means this computer and may be used to access the computer’s own network services via its loopback network interface. Using the loopback interface bypasses local network interface hardware. In this case the HTTPS://127.0.01 was used and not HTTPS//localhost </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902K71"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>The sender uses his private key, in this case Ann’s private key, to create a digital signature. The message is, in effect, signed with the private key. The sender then sends the message to the receiver. The receiver uses the public key attached to the message to validate the digital signature. If the values match, the receiver knows the message is authentic. The receiver uses a key provided by the sender—the public key—to decrypt the message. Most digital signature implementations also use a hash to verify that the message has not been altered, intentionally or accidently, in transit. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902K74"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Preventive controls are to stop something from happening. These can include locked doors that keep intruders out, user training on potential harm (to keep them vigilant and alert), or even biometric devices and guards that deny access until authentication has occurred. By disabling all unnecessary services you would be reducing the attack surface because then there is less opportunity for risk incidents to happen. There are many risks with having many services enabled since a service can provide an attack vector that someone could exploit against your system. It is thus best practice to enable only those services that are absolutely required. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902K81"><span><b>Answer: A,F </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Implicit deny is the default security stance that says if you aren’t specifically granted access or privileges for a resource, you’re denied access by default. Implicit deny is the default response when an explicit allow or deny isn’t present. </p>
<p>DNS operates over TCP and UDP port 53. TCP port 53 is used for zone transfers. These are zone file exchanges between DNS servers, special manual queries, or used when a response exceeds 512 bytes. UDP port 53 is used for most typical DNS queries. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902K82"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>You can run a script to return a list of all accounts that haven’t been used for a number of days, for example 30 days. If an account hasn’t been logged into for 30 days, it’s a safe bet that the user the account belonged to is no longer with the company. You can then disable all the accounts that the script returns. A disabled account cannot be used to log in to a system. This is a good security measure. As soon as an employee leaves the company, the employees account should always be disabled. </p></span> </div>

<p><b>Four weeks ago, a network administrator applied a new IDS and allowed it to gather baseline data.

Which of the following kind of IDS is in use? <br/></b></p>
<p>A. Protocol based <br/>B. Heuristic based <br/>C. Signature based <br/>D. Anomaly based </p>
<style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>
<p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902K85').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902K85"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Most intrusion detection systems (IDS) are what is known as signature-based. This means that they operate in much the same way as a virus scanner, by searching for a known identity – or signature – for each specific intrusion event. And, while signature-based IDS is very efficient at sniffing out known methods of attack, it does, like anti-virus software, depend on receiving regular signature updates, to keep in touch with variations in hacker technique. In other words, signature-based IDS is only as good as its database of stored signatures. Any organization wanting to implement a more thorough – and hence safer – solution, should consider what we call anomaly-based IDS. By its nature, anomaly-based IDS is a rather more complex creature. In network traffic terms, it captures all the headers of the IP packets running towards the network. From this, it filters out all known and legal traffic, including web traffic to the organization’s web server, mail traffic to and from its mail server, outgoing web traffic from company employees and DNS traffic to and from its DNS server. </p>
<p>There are other equally obvious advantages to using anomaly-based IDS. For example, because it detects any traffic that is new or unusual, the anomaly method is particularly good at identifying sweeps and probes towards network hardware. It can, therefore, give early warnings of potential intrusions, because probes and scans are the predecessors of all attacks. And this applies equally to any new service installed on any item of hardware – for example, Telnet deployed on a network router for maintenance purposes and forgotten about when the maintenance was finished. This makes anomaly-based IDS perfect for detecting anything from port anomalies and web anomalies to mis-formed attacks, where the URL is deliberately mis-typed. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902K87"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>We can see in this question that a fraudulent entry has been added to the user’s hosts file. This will point the URL: www.comptia.com to 5.5.5.5 instead of the correct IP address. Similar in nature to e-mail phishing, pharming seeks to obtain personal or private (usually financial related) information through domain spoofing. Rather than being spammed with malicious and mischievous e-mail requests for you to visit spoof Web sites which appear legitimate, pharming ‘poisons’ a DNS server (or hosts file) by infusing false information into the DNS server, resulting in a user’s request being redirected elsewhere. Your browser, however will show you are at the correct Web site, which makes pharming a bit more serious and more difficult to detect. Phishing attempts to scam people one at a time with an e-mail while pharming allows the scammers to target large groups of people at one time through domain spoofing. </p></span> </div>

<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>B: MD5 biggest weakness is that it does not have strong collision resistance, and thus it is no longer recommended for use. </p>
<p>C: SHA-1 (also known as SHA) is being retired from most government uses; the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology said, “Federal agencies should stop using SHA-1 for…applications that require collision resistance as soon as practical, and must use the SHA-2 family of hash functions for these applications after 2010”, though that was later relaxed. Note: The hashing algorithm must have few or no collisions. This means that hashing two different inputs does not give the same output. Cryptographic hash functions are usually designed to be collision resistant. But many hash functions that were once thought to be collision resistant were later broken. MD5 and SHA-1 in particular both have published techniques more efficient than brute force for finding collisions. </p></span> </div>

<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Definitions of precisely what an APT is can vary widely, but can best be summarized by their named requirements: Advanced – Criminal operators behind the threat utilize the full spectrum of computer intrusion technologies and techniques. While individual components of the attack may not be classed as particularly “advanced” (e.g. malware components generated from commonly available DIY construction kits, or the use of easily procured exploit materials), their operators can typically access and develop more advanced tools as required. They combine multiple attack methodologies and tools in order to reach and compromise their target. Persistent – Criminal operators give priority to a specific task, rather than opportunistically seeking immediate financial gain. This distinction implies that the attackers are guided by external entities. The attack is conducted through continuous monitoring and interaction in order to achieve the defined objectives. It does not mean a barrage of constant attacks and malware updates. In fact, a “low-and-slow” approach is usually more successful. Threat – means that there is a level of coordinated human involvement in the attack, rather than a mindless and automated piece of code. The criminal operators have a specific objective and are skilled, motivated, organized and well funded. </p></span> </div>
