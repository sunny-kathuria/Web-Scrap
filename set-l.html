<p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902L4').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L4"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>In this question, we have a source computer (192.10.3.204) sending data to a single destination IP address 10.10.1.5. No data is being received back by source computer which suggests the data being sent is some kind of Denial-of-service attack. This is common practice for computers participating in a botnet. The port used is TCP 6667 which is IRC (Internet Relay Chat). This port is used by many Trojans and is commonly used for DoS attacks. </p>
<p>Software running on infected computers called zombies is often known as a botnet. Bots, by themselves, are but a form of software that runs automatically and autonomously. (For example, Google uses the Googlebot to find web pages and bring back values for the index.) Botnet, however, has come to be the word used to describe malicious software running on a zombie and under the control of a bot-herder. Denial-of-service attacks—DoS and DDoS—can be launched by botnets, as can many forms of adware, spyware, and spam (via spambots). Most bots are written to run in the background with no visible evidence of their presence. Many malware kits can be used to create botnets and modify existing ones. </p></span> </div>

<p>A. Vishing <br/>B. Bluejacking <br/>C. War Driving <br/>D. SPIM <br/>E. Bluesnarfing </p>
<style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>
<p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902L6').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L6"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Bluejacking is the sending of unsolicited messages over Bluetooth to Bluetooth-enabled devices such as mobile phones, PDAs or laptop computers, sending a vCard which typically contains a message in the name field (i.e., for bluedating or bluechat) to another Bluetooth-enabled device via the OBEX protocol. Bluetooth has a very limited range, usually around 10 metres (32.8 ft) on mobile phones, but laptops can reach up to 100 metres (328 ft) with powerful (Class 1) transmitters. Bluejacking is usually harmless, but because bluejacked people generally don’t know what has happened, they may think that their phone is malfunctioning. Usually, a bluejacker will only send a text message, but with modern phones it’s possible to send images or sounds as well. Bluejacking has been used in guerrilla marketing campaigns to promote advergames. </p></span> </div>

<style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>
<p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902L8').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L8"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attack from several different computers targeting a single computer. One common method of attack involves saturating the target machine with external communications requests, so much so that it cannot respond to legitimate traffic, or responds so slowly as to be rendered essentially unavailable. Such attacks usually lead to a server overload. </p>
<p>A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers. Such an attack is often the result of multiple compromised systems (for example a botnet) flooding the targeted system with traffic. When a server is overloaded with connections, new connections can no longer be accepted. The major advantages to an attacker of using a distributed denial-of-service attack are that multiple machines can generate more attack traffic than one machine, multiple attack machines are harder to turn off than one attack machine, and that the behavior of each attack machine can be stealthier, making it harder to track and shut down. These attacker advantages cause challenges for defense mechanisms. For example, merely purchasing more incoming bandwidth than the current volume of the attack might not help, because the attacker might be able to simply add more attack machines. This after all will end up completely crashing a website for periods of time. Malware can carry DDoS attack mechanisms; one of the better-known examples of this was MyDoom. Its DoS mechanism was triggered on a specific date and time. This type of DDoS involved hardcoding the target IP address prior to release of the malware and no further interaction was necessary to launch the attack. </p></span> </div>

<p>A. Deny incoming connections to the outside router interface. <br/>B. Change the default HTTP port <br/>C. Implement EAP-TLS to establish mutual authentication <br/>D. Disable the physical switch ports <br/>E. Create a server VLAN <br/>F. Create an ACL to access the server </p>
<style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L10"><span><b>Answer: E,F </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>We can protect the servers from the user devices by separating them into separate VLANs (virtual local area networks). </p>
<p>The network device in the question is a router/switch. We can use the router to allow access from devices in one VLAN to the servers in the other VLAN. We can configure an ACL (Access Control List) on the router to determine who is able to access the server. </p>
<p>In computer networking, a single layer-2 network may be partitioned to create multiple distinct broadcast domains, which are mutually isolated so that packets can only pass between them via one or more routers; such a domain is referred to as a virtual local area network, virtual LAN or VLAN. This is usually achieved on switch or router devices. Simpler devices only support partitioning on a port level (if at all), so sharing VLANs across devices requires running dedicated cabling for each VLAN. More sophisticated devices can mark packets through tagging, so that a single interconnect (trunk) may be used to transport data for multiple VLANs. Grouping hosts with a common set of requirements regardless of their physical location by VLAN can greatly simplify network design. A VLAN has the same attributes as a physical local area network (LAN), but it allows for end stations to be grouped together more easily even if they are not on the same network switch. The network described in this question is a DMZ, not a VLAN. </p></span> </div>

<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>XSRF or cross-site request forgery applies to web applications and is an attack that exploits the web application’s trust of a user who known or is supposed to have been authenticated. This is accomplished by changing values in the HTTP header and even in the user’s cookie to falsify access. It can be prevented by embedding additional authentication data into requests that allows the web application to detect requests from unauthorized locations. Examples are synchronizer token patterns, cookie-to-header tokens, and checking the HTTP Referrer header and the HTTP Origin header. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L16"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A digital signature is a mathematical technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message, software, or digital document. The digital equivalent of a handwritten signature or stamped seal, but offering far more inherent security, a digital signature is intended to solve the problem of tampering and impersonation in digital communications. Digital signatures can provide the added assurances of evidence to origin, identity and status of an electronic document, transaction or message, as well as acknowledging informed consent by the signer. Digital signatures are based on public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography. Using a public key algorithm such as RSA, one can generate two keys that are mathematically linked: one private and one public. To create a digital signature, signing software (such as an email program) creates a one-way hash of the electronic data to be signed. The private key is then used to encrypt the hash. The encrypted hash — along with other information, such as the hashing algorithm — is the digital signature. The reason for encrypting the hash instead of the entire message or document is that a hash function can convert an arbitrary input into a fixed length value, which is usually much shorter. This saves time since hashing is much faster than signing. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L25"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Salting can be used to strengthen the hashing when the passwords were encrypted. Though hashing is a one-way algorithm it does not mean that it cannot be hacked. One method to hack a hash is though rainbow tables and salt is the counter measure to rainbow tables. With salt a password that you typed in and that has been encrypted with a hash will yield a letter combination other than what you actually types in when it is rainbow table attacked. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L27"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A RADIUS server is a server with a database of user accounts and passwords used as a central authentication database for users requiring network access. The Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) is a proprietary wireless LAN authentication method developed by Cisco Systems. Important features of LEAP are dynamic WEP keys and mutual authentication (between a wireless client and a RADIUS server). LEAP allows for clients to reauthenticate frequently; upon each successful authentication, the clients acquire a new WEP key (with the hope that the WEP keys don’t live long enough to be cracked). LEAP may be configured to use TKIP instead of dynamic WEP. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L31"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Auditors (employees performing the auditor role) will have access application by reviewing the logs. We can therefore assign access based on employee role. This is an example of Role-based access control (RBAC). To prevent the auditors from modifying passwords in the application, we need to ensure that they do not have write access. Therefore, you should assign only read access. </p>
<p>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) models approach the problem of access control based on established roles in an organization. RBAC models implement access by job function or by responsibility. Each employee has one or more roles that allow access to specific information. If a person moves from one role to another, the access for the previous role will no longer be available. Instead of thinking “Denise needs to be able to edit files,” RBAC uses the logic “Editors need to be able to edit files” and “Denise is a member of the Editors group.” This model is always good for use in an environment in which there is high employee turnover. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L32"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Steganography is the process of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. Note: The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable will arouse interest, and may in themselves be incriminating in countries where encryption is illegal. Thus, whereas cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a message alone, steganography is concerned with concealing the fact that a secret message is being sent, as well as concealing the contents of the message. </p></span> </div>

<p><b>Which of the following is the MOST intrusive type of testing against a production system? <br/></b></p>
<p>A. White box testing <br/>B. War dialing <br/>C. Vulnerability testing <br/>D. Penetration testing </p>
<style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>
<p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902L34').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L34"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Penetration testing is the most intrusive type of testing because you are actively trying to circumvent the system’s security controls to gain access to the system. Penetration testing (also called pen testing) is the practice of testing a computer system, network or Web application to find vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit. Pen tests can be automated with software applications or they can be performed manually. Either way, the process includes gathering information about the target before the test (reconnaissance), identifying possible entry points, attempting to break in (either virtually or for real) and reporting back the findings. The main objective of penetration testing is to determine security weaknesses. A pen test can also be used to test an organization’s security policy compliance, its employees’ security awareness and the organization’s ability to identify and respond to security incidents. Penetration tests are sometimes called white hat attacks because in a pen test, the good guys are attempting to break in. </p>
<p>Pen test strategies include: </p>
<p>Targeted testing Targeted testing is performed by the organization’s IT team and the penetration testing team working together. It’s sometimes referred to as a “lights-turned-on” approach because everyone can see the test being carried out. </p>
<p>External testing This type of pen test targets a company’s externally visible servers or devices including domain name servers (DNS), e-mail servers, Web servers or firewalls. The objective is to find out if an outside attacker can get in and how far they can get in once they’ve gained access. </p>
<p>Internal testing This test mimics an inside attack behind the firewall by an authorized user with standard access privileges. This kind of test is useful for estimating how much damage a disgruntled employee could cause. </p>
<p>Blind testing A blind test strategy simulates the actions and procedures of a real attacker by severely limiting the information given to the person or team that’s performing the test beforehand. Typically, they may only be given the name of the company. Because this type of test can require a considerable amount of time for reconnaissance, it can be expensive. </p>
<p>Double blind testing Double blind testing takes the blind test and carries it a step further. In this type of pen test, only one or two people within the organization might be aware a test is being conducted. Double-blind tests can be useful for testing an organization’s security monitoring and incident identification as well as its response procedures. </p></span> </div>

<style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L35"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A logic bomb is a piece of code intentionally inserted into a software system that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met. For example, a programmer may hide a piece of code that starts deleting files should they ever be terminated from the company. Software that is inherently malicious, such as viruses and worms, often contain logic bombs that execute a certain payload at a pre-defined time or when some other condition is met. This technique can be used by a virus or worm to gain momentum and spread before being noticed. Some viruses attack their host systems on specific dates, such as Friday the 13th or April Fool’s Day. Trojans that activate on certain dates are often called “time bombs”. To be considered a logic bomb, the payload should be unwanted and unknown to the user of the software. As an example, trial programs with code that disables certain functionality after a set time are not normally regarded as logic bombs. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L36"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>An initialization vector is a random number used in combination with a secret key as a means to encrypt data. This number is sometimes referred to as a nonce, or “number occurring once,” as an encryption program uses it only once per session. An initialization vector is used to avoid repetition during the data encryption process, making it impossible for hackers who use dictionary attack to decrypt the exchanged encrypted message by discovering a pattern. This is known as an IV attack. A particular binary sequence may be repeated more than once in a message, and the more it appears, the more the encryption method is discoverable. For example if a one-letter word exists in a message, it may be either “a” or “I” but it can’t be “e” because the word “e” is non-sensical in English, while “a” has a meaning and “I” has a meaning. Repeating the words and letters makes it possible for software to apply a dictionary and discover the binary sequence corresponding to each letter. Using an initialization vector changes the binary sequence corresponding to each letter, enabling the letter “a” to be represented by a particular sequence in the first instance, and then represented by a completely different binary sequence in the second instance. </p>
<p>WEP (Wireless Equivalent Privacy) is vulnerable to an IV attack. Because RC4 is a stream cipher, the same traffic key must never be used twice. The purpose of an IV, which is transmitted as plain text, is to prevent any repetition, but a 24-bit IV is not long enough to ensure this on a busy network. The way the IV was used also opened WEP to a related key attack. For a 24-bit IV, there is a 50% probability the same IV will repeat after 5000 packets. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L39"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>The basic process of Kerberos authentication is as follows: The subject provides logon credentials. The Kerberos client system encrypts the password and transmits the protected credentials to the KDC. The KDC verifies the credentials and then creates a ticket-granting ticket (TGT—a hashed form of the subject’s password with the addition of a time stamp that indicates a valid lifetime). The TGT is encrypted and sent to the client. The client receives the TGT. At this point, the subject is an authenticated principle in the Kerberos realm. The subject requests access to resources on a network server. This causes the client to request a service ticket (ST) from the KDC. The KDC verifies that the client has a valid TGT and then issues an ST to the client. The ST includes a time stamp that indicates its valid lifetime. The client receives the ST. The client sends the ST to the network server that hosts the desired resource. The network server verifies the ST. If it’s verified, it initiates a communication session with the client. From this point forward, Kerberos is no longer involved. </p></span> </div>

<p><b>Due to hardware limitation, a technician must implement a wireless encryption algorithm that uses the RC4 protocol. Which of the following is a wireless encryption solution that the technician should implement while ensuring the STRONGEST level of security? <br/></b></p>
<p>A. WPA2-AES <br/>B. 802.11ac <br/>C. WPA-TKIP <br/>D. WEP </p>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L48"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>WPA-TKIP uses the RC4 cipher. </p>
<p>TKIP and the related WPA standard implement three new security features to address security problems encountered in WEP protected networks. First, TKIP implements a key mixing function that combines the secret root key with the initialization vector before passing it to the RC4 initialization. WEP, in comparison, merely concatenated the initialization vector to the root key, and passed this value to the RC4 routine. This permitted the vast majority of the RC4 based WEP related key attacks. Second, WPA implements a sequence counter to protect against replay attacks. Packets received out of order will be rejected by the access point. Finally, TKIP implements a 64-bit Message Integrity Check (MIC) To be able to run on legacy WEP hardware with minor upgrades, TKIP uses RC4 as its cipher. TKIP also provides a rekeying mechanism. TKIP ensures that every data packet is sent with a unique encryption key. </p></span> </div>

<p><b>Which of the following authentication services uses a ticket granting system to provide access? <br/></b></p>
<p>A. RADIUS <br/>B. LDAP <br/>C. TACACS+ <br/>D. Kerberos </p>
<style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L49"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>The basic process of Kerberos authentication is as follows: The subject provides logon credentials. The Kerberos client system encrypts the password and transmits the protected credentials to the KDC. The KDC verifies the credentials and then creates a ticket-granting ticket (TGT—a hashed form of the subject’s password with the addition of a time stamp that indicates a valid lifetime). The TGT is encrypted and sent to the client. The client receives the TGT. At this point, the subject is an authenticated principle in the Kerberos realm. The subject requests access to resources on a network server. This causes the client to request a service ticket (ST) from the KDC. The KDC verifies that the client has a valid TGT and then issues an ST to the client. The ST includes a time stamp that indicates its valid lifetime. The client receives the ST. The client sends the ST to the network server that hosts the desired resource. The network server verifies the ST. If it’s verified, it initiates a communication session with the client. From this point forward, Kerberos is no longer involved. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L54"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>The problems listed in this question can be caused by problems with the application code. Reviewing the code will help to prevent the problems. The purpose of code review is to look at all custom written code for holes that may exist. The review needs also to examine changes that the code—most likely in the form of a finished application—may make: configuration files, libraries, and the like. During this examination, look for threats such as opportunities for injection to occur (SQL, LDAP, code, and so on), cross-site request forgery, and authentication. Code review is often conducted as a part of gray box testing. Looking at source code can often be one of the easiest ways to find weaknesses within the application. Simply reading the code is known as manual assessment, whereas using tools to scan the code is known as automated assessment. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L60"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A vulnerability scan is the automated process of proactively identifying security vulnerabilities of computing systems in a network in order to determine if and where a system can be exploited and/or threatened. While public servers are important for communication and data transfer over the Internet, they open the door to potential security breaches by threat agents, such as malicious hackers. Vulnerability scanning employs software that seeks out security flaws based on a database of known flaws, testing systems for the occurrence of these flaws and generating a report of the findings that an individual or an enterprise can use to tighten the network’s security. Vulnerability scanning typically refers to the scanning of systems that are connected to the Internet but can also refer to system audits on internal networks that are not connected to the Internet in order to assess the threat of rogue software or malicious employees in an enterprise. </p></span> </div>

<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Directory services play an important role in developing intranet and Internet applications by allowing the sharing of information about users, systems, networks, services, and applications throughout the network. As examples, directory services may provide any organized set of records, often with a hierarchical structure, such as a corporate email directory. Similarly, a telephone directory is a list of subscribers with an address and a phone number. </p>
<p>A common usage of LDAP is to provide a “single sign on” where one password for a user is shared between many services, such as applying a company login code to web pages (so that staff log in only once to company computers, and then are automatically logged into the company intranet). LDAP is based on a simpler subset of the standards contained within the X.500 standard. Because of this relationship, LDAP is sometimes called X.500-lite. </p>
<p>A client starts an LDAP session by connecting to an LDAP server, called a Directory System Agent (DSA), by default on TCP and UDP port 389, or on port 636 for LDAPS. Global Catalog is available by default on ports 3268, and 3269 for LDAPS. The client then sends an operation request to the server, and the server sends responses in return. The client may request the following operations: StartTLS — use the LDAPv3 Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension for a secure connection </p></span> </div>

<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Peter wants to send a message to Ann. It’s important that this message not be altered. Peter will use the private key to create a digital signature. The message is, in effect, signed with the private key. Peter then sends the message to Ann. Ann will use the public key attached to the message to validate the digital signature. If the values match, Ann knows the message is authentic and came from Peter. Ann will use a key provided by Peter—the public key—to decrypt the message. Most digital signature implementations also use a hash to verify that the message has not been altered, intentionally or accidently, in transit. Thus Ann would compare the signature area referred to as a message in the message with the calculated value digest (her private key in this case). If the values match, the message hasn’t been tampered with and the originator is verified as the person they claim to be. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L82"><span><b>Answer: A </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>The exhibit shows that all the computers on the network are being ‘pinged’. This indicates that the ping request was sent to the network broadcast address. We can also see that all the replies were received by one (probably with a spoofed address) host on the network. This is typical of a smurf attack. </p>
<p>A smurf attack is a type of network security breach in which a network connected to the Internet is swamped with replies to ICMP echo (PING) requests. A smurf attacker sends PING requests to an Internet broadcast address. These are special addresses that broadcast all received messages to the hosts connected to the subnet. Each broadcast address can support up to 255 hosts, so a single PING request can be multiplied 255 times. The return address of the request itself is spoofed to be the address of the attacker’s victim. All the hosts receiving the PING request reply to this victim’s address instead of the real sender’s address. A single attacker sending hundreds or thousands of these PING messages per second can fill the victim’s T-1 (or even T-3) line with ping replies, bring the entire Internet service to its knees. Smurfing falls under the general category of Denial of Service attacks — security attacks that don’t try to steal information, but instead attempt to disable a computer or network. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L86"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Bluesnarfing is the theft of information from a wireless device through a Bluetooth connection. Bluetooth is a high-speed but very short-range wireless technology for exchanging data between desktop and mobile computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and other devices. By exploiting a vulnerability in the way Bluetooth is implemented on a mobile phone, an attacker can access information — such as the user’s calendar, contact list and e-mail and text messages -­without leaving any evidence of the attack. Other devices that use Bluetooth, such as laptop computers, may also be vulnerable, although to a lesser extent, by virtue of their more complex systems. Operating in invisible mode protects some devices, but others are vulnerable as long as Bluetooth is enabled. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902L87"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>User account control is a very important part of operating system hardening. It is important that only active accounts be operational and that they be properly managed. This means disabling unnecessary accounts. Enabled accounts that are not needed on a system provide a door through which attackers can gain access. You should disable all accounts that are not needed immediately—on servers and workstations alike. Here are some types of accounts that you should disable: Employees Who Have Left the Company: Be sure to disable immediately accounts for any employee who has left the company. This should be done the minute employment is terminated. Temporary Employees: It is not uncommon to create short-term accounts for brief periods of time for access by temporary employees. These also need to be disabled the moment they are no longer needed. Default Guest Accounts: In many operating systems, a guest account is created during installation and intended for use by those needing only limited access and lacking their own account on the system. This account presents a door into the system that should not be there, and all who have worked with the operating system knows of its existence, thus making it a likely target for attackers. </p></span> </div>
