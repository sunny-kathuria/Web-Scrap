<p>A. Implement a honeynet <br/>B. Perform a penetration test <br/>C. Examine firewall logs <br/>D. Deploy an IDS </p>
<style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>
<p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902H2').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902H2"><span><b>Answer: A </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A honeynet is a network set up with intentional vulnerabilities; its purpose is to invite attack, so that an attacker’s activities and methods can be studied and that information used to increase network security. A honeynet contains one or more honey pots, which are computer systems on the Internet expressly set up to attract and “trap” people who attempt to penetrate other people’s computer systems. Although the primary purpose of a honeynet is to gather information about attackers’ methods and motives, the decoy network can benefit its operator in other ways, for example by diverting attackers from a real network and its resources. The Honeynet Project, a non-profit research organization dedicated to computer security and information sharing, actively promotes the deployment of honeynets. In addition to the honey pots, a honeynet usually has real applications and services so that it seems like a normal network and a worthwhile target. However, because the honeynet doesn’t actually serve any authorized users, any attempt to contact the network from without is likely an illicit attempt to breach its security, and any outbound activity is likely evidence that a system has been compromised. For this reason, the suspect information is much more apparent than it would be in an actual network, where it would have to be found amidst all the legitimate network data. Applications within a honeynet are often given names such as “Finances” or “Human Services” to make them sound appealing to the attacker. </p>
<p>A virtual honeynet is one that, while appearing to be an entire network, resides on a single server. </p></span> </div>

<p><b>An administrator notices an unusual spike in network traffic from many sources. The administrator suspects that: <br/></b></p>
<p>A. it is being caused by the presence of a rogue access point. <br/>B. it is the beginning of a DDoS attack. <br/>C. the IDS has been compromised. <br/>D. the internal DNS tables have been poisoned. </p>
<style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>
<p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902H4').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902H4"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attack from several different computers targeting a single computer. One common method of attack involves saturating the target machine with external communications requests, so much so that it cannot respond to legitimate traffic, or responds so slowly as to be rendered essentially unavailable. Such attacks usually lead to a server overload. </p>
<p>A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers. Such an attack is often the result of multiple compromised systems (for example a botnet) flooding the targeted system with traffic. When a server is overloaded with connections, new connections can no longer be accepted. The major advantages to an attacker of using a distributed denial-of-service attack are that multiple machines can generate more attack traffic than one machine, multiple attack machines are harder to turn off than one attack machine, and that the behavior of each attack machine can be stealthier, making it harder to track and shut down. These attacker advantages cause challenges for defense mechanisms. For example, merely purchasing more incoming bandwidth than the current volume of the attack might not help, because the attacker might be able to simply add more attack machines. This after all will end up completely crashing a website for periods of time. Malware can carry DDoS attack mechanisms; one of the better-known examples of this was MyDoom. Its DoS mechanism was triggered on a specific date and time. This type of DDoS involved hardcoding the target IP address prior to release of the malware and no further interaction was necessary to launch the attack. </p></span> </div>

<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>The most common threat to an organization is computer viruses or malware. A computer can become infected with a virus through day-to-day activities such as browsing web sites or emails. As browsing and opening emails are the most common activities performed by all users, computer viruses represent the most likely risk to a business. Common examples of malware include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware. Viruses, for example, can cause havoc on a computer’s hard drive by deleting files or directory information. Spyware can gather data from a user’s system without the user knowing it.

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902H18"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>One way to recover a user’s forgotten password on a password protected file is to guess it. A brute force attack is an automated attempt to open the file by using many different passwords. </p>
<p>A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as a user password or personal identification number (PIN). In a brute force attack, automated software is used to generate a large number of consecutive guesses as to the value of the desired data. Brute force attacks may be used by criminals to crack encrypted data, or by security analysts to test an organization’s network security. A brute force attack may also be referred to as brute force cracking. For example, a form of brute force attack known as a dictionary attack might try all the words in a dictionary. Other forms of brute force attack might try commonly-used passwords or combinations of letters and numbers. An attack of this nature can be time- and resource-consuming. Hence the name “brute force attack;” success is usually based on computing power and the number of combinations tried rather than an ingenious algorithm. </p></span> </div>

<p>A. Ensure the vulnerability scanner is located in a segmented VLAN that has access to the company’s servers <br/>B. Ensure the vulnerability scanner is configured to authenticate with a privileged account <br/>C. Ensure the vulnerability scanner is attempting to exploit the weaknesses it discovers <br/>D. Ensure the vulnerability scanner is conducting antivirus scanning </p>
<style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>
<p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902H19').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902H19"><span><b>Answer: A </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>The vulnerability scanner is returning false positives because it is trying to scan servers that it doesn’t have access to; for example, servers on the Internet. We need to ensure that the local network servers only are scanned. We can do this by locating the vulnerability scanner in a segmented VLAN that has access to the company’s servers. </p>
<p>A false positive is an error in some evaluation process in which a condition tested for is mistakenly found to have been detected. In spam filters, for example, a false positive is a legitimate message mistakenly marked as UBE -­unsolicited bulk email, as junk email is more formally known. Messages that are determined to be spam — whether correctly or incorrectly — may be rejected by a server or client-side spam filter and returned to the sender as bounce e-mail. One problem with many spam filtering tools is that if they are configured stringently enough to be effective, there is a fairly high chance of getting false positives. The risk of accidentally blocking an important message has been enough to deter many companies from implementing any anti-spam measures at all. False positives are also common in security systems. A host intrusion prevention system (HIPS), for example, looks for anomalies, such as deviations in bandwidth, protocols and ports. When activity varies outside of an acceptable range – for example, a remote application attempting to open a normally closed port — an intrusion may be in progress. However, an anomaly, such as a sudden spike in bandwidth use, does not guarantee an actual attack, so this approach amounts to an educated guess and the chance for false positives can be high. False positives contrast with false negatives, which are results indicating mistakenly that some condition tested for is absent. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902H20"><span><b>Answer: B </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>When a web user takes advantage of a weakness with SQL by entering values that they should not, it is known as a SQL injection attack. Similarly, when the user enters values that query XML (known as XPath) with values that take advantage of exploits, it is known as an XML injection attack. XPath works in a similar manner to SQL, except that it does not have the same levels of access control, and taking advantage of weaknesses within can return entire documents. The best way to prevent XML injection attacks is to filter the user’s input and sanitize it to make certain that it does not cause XPath to return more data than it should. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902H23"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A host-based firewall is designed to protect the host from network based attack by using filters to limit the network traffic that is allowed to enter or leave the host. The action of a filter is to allow, deny, or log the network packet. Allow enables the packet to continue toward its destination. Deny blocks the packet from going any further and effectively discarding it. Log records information about the packet into a log file. Filters can be based on protocol and ports. By blocking protocols and ports that are not required, other potentially compromised application services would be prevented from being exploited across the network. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902H27"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A user account with administrative rights has the same rights as an administrator account on a computer. An administrator account is a user account that lets you make changes that will affect other users. Administrators can change security settings, install software and hardware, and access all files on the computer. Administrators can also make changes to other user accounts. This compares to a standard user (non-administrative) account which has limited rights on a computer. For example, a standard user account cannot install software, cannot make system changes that would affect other users and cannot access other users’ files. Therefore, a compromised user account with administrative rights has the potential for the most damage. </p></span> </div>

<p><b>Failure to validate the size of a variable before writing it to memory could result in which of the following application attacks? <br/></b></p>
<p>A. Malicious logic <br/>B. Cross-site scripting <br/>C. SQL injection <br/>D. Buffer overflow </p>
<style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>
<p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902H29').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902H29"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A buffer overflow occurs when a program or process tries to store more data in a buffer (temporary data storage area) than it was intended to hold. Since buffers are created to contain a finite amount of data, the extra information – which has to go somewhere – can overflow into adjacent buffers, corrupting or overwriting the valid data held in them. Although it may occur accidentally through programming error, buffer overflow is an increasingly common type of security attack on data integrity. In buffer overflow attacks, the extra data may contain codes designed to trigger specific actions, in effect sending new instructions to the attacked computer that could, for example, damage the user’s files, change data, or disclose confidential information. Validating the size of a variable before writing it to memory will ensure that the variable can fit into the buffer. Failure to validate the size of a variable before writing it to memory can result in a buffer overflow. </p></span> </div>

<p><b>Which of the following BEST describes a protective countermeasure for SQL injection? <br/></b></p>
<p>A. Eliminating cross-site scripting vulnerabilities <br/>B. Installing an IDS to monitor network traffic <br/>C. Validating user input in web applications <br/>D. Placing a firewall between the Internet and database servers </p>
<style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>
<p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902H30').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902H30"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>By validating user input and preventing special characters, we can prevent the injection of client-side scripting code. SQL injection is a code injection technique, used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker). SQL injection must exploit a security vulnerability in an application’s software, for example, when user input is either incorrectly filtered for string literal escape characters embedded in SQL statements or user input is not strongly typed and unexpectedly executed. SQL injection is mostly known as an attack vector for websites but can be used to attack any type of SQL database. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902H31"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>
The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Directory services play an important role in developing intranet and Internet applications by allowing the sharing of information about users, systems, networks, services, and applications throughout the network. As examples, directory services may provide any organized set of records, often with a hierarchical structure, such as a corporate email directory. Similarly, a telephone directory is a list of subscribers with an address and a phone number.</p>
<p>An entry can look like this when represented in LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) (LDAP itself is a binary protocol): dn: cn=John Doe,dc=example,dc=com cn: John Doe givenName: John sn: Doe telephoneNumber: +1 888 555 6789 telephoneNumber: +1 888 555 1232 mail: john@example.com manager: cn=Barbara Doe,dc=example,dc=com objectClass: inetOrgPerson objectClass: organizationalPerson objectClass: person objectClass: top</p>
<p>“dn” is the distinguished name of the entry; it is neither an attribute nor a part of the entry. “cn=John Doe” is the entry’s RDN (Relative Distinguished Name), and “dc=example,dc=com” is the DN of the parent entry, where “dc” denotes ‘Domain Component’. The other lines show the attributes in the entry. Attribute names are typically mnemonic strings, like “cn” for common name, “dc” for domain component, “mail” for e-mail address, and “sn” for surname.</p>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902H39"><span><b>Answer: A </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Rootkits are software programs that have the ability to hide certain things from the operating system. With a rootkit, there may be a number of processes running on a system that do not show up in Task Manager or connections established or available that do not appear in a netstat display—the rootkit masks the presence of these items. The rootkit is able to do this by manipulating function calls to the operating system and filtering out information that would normally appear. Theoretically, rootkits could hide anywhere that there is enough memory to reside: video cards, PCI cards, and the like. The best way to handle this situation is to wipe the server and reinstall the operating system with the original installation disks and then restore the extracted data from your last known good backup. This way you can eradicate the rootkit and restore the data. </p></span> </div>

<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations and produces reports to a management station. IDS come in a variety of “flavors” and approach the goal of detecting suspicious traffic in different ways. There are network based (NIDS) and host based (HIDS) intrusion detection systems. Some systems may attempt to stop an intrusion attempt but this is neither required nor expected of a monitoring system. Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) are primarily focused on identifying possible incidents, logging information about them, and reporting attempts. In addition, organizations use IDPSes for other purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies, documenting existing threats and deterring individuals from violating security policies. IDPSes have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization. IDPSes typically record information related to observed events, notify security administrators of important observed events and produce reports. Many IDPSes can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding. They use several response techniques, which involve the IDPS stopping the attack itself, changing the security environment (e.g. reconfiguring a firewall) or changing the attack’s content. </p></span> </div>

<div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902H53"><span><b>Answer: A </b>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>The vulnerability was unknown in that the full antivirus scan did not detect it. This is zero day vulnerability. A zero day vulnerability refers to a hole in software that is unknown to the vendor. This security hole is then exploited by hackers before the vendor becomes aware and hurries to fix it—this exploit is called a zero day attack. Uses of zero day attacks can include infiltrating malware, spyware or allowing unwanted access to user information. The term “zero day” refers to the unknown nature of the hole to those outside of the hackers, specifically, the developers. Once the vulnerability becomes known, a race begins for the developer, who must protect users. </p></span> </div>

    <p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A rootkit is a collection of tools (programs) that enable administrator-level access to a computer or computer network. Typically, a cracker installs a rootkit on a computer after first obtaining user-level access, either by exploiting a known vulnerability or cracking a password. Once the rootkit is installed, it allows the attacker to mask intrusion and gain root or privileged access to the computer and, possibly, other machines on the network. A rootkit may consist of spyware and other programs that: monitor traffic and keystrokes; create a “backdoor” into the system for the hacker’s use; alter log files; attack other machines on the network; and alter existing system tools to escape detection. The presence of a rootkit on a network was first documented in the early 1990s. At that time, Sun and Linux operating systems were the primary targets for a hacker looking to install a rootkit. Today, rootkits are available for a number of operating systems, including Windows, and are increasingly difficult to detect on any network. </p></span> </div>

    <div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902H73"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a DoS attack from multiple computers whereas a DoS attack is from a single computer. In terms of the actual method of attack, DDoS and DoS attacks are the same. One common method of attack involves saturating the target machine with external communications requests, so much so that it cannot respond to legitimate traffic, or responds so slowly as to be rendered essentially unavailable. Such attacks usually lead to a server overload. A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers. Such an attack is often the result of multiple compromised systems (for example a botnet) flooding the targeted system with traffic. When a server is overloaded with connections, new connections can no longer be accepted. The major advantages to an attacker of using a distributed denial-of-service attack are that multiple machines can generate more attack traffic than one machine, multiple attack machines are harder to turn off than one attack machine, and that the behavior of each attack machine can be stealthier, making it harder to track and shut down. These attacker advantages cause challenges for defense mechanisms. For example, merely purchasing more incoming bandwidth than the current volume of the attack might not help, because the attacker might be able to simply add more attack machines. This after all will end up completely crashing a website for periods of time. Malware can carry DDoS attack mechanisms; one of the better-known examples of this was MyDoom. Its DoS mechanism was triggered on a specific date and time. This type of DDoS involved hardcoding the target IP address prior to release of the malware and no further interaction was necessary to launch the attack. </p></span> </div>

    <div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902H75"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Different services use different ports. When a service is enabled on a computer, a network port is opened for that service. For example, enabling the HTTP service on a web server will open port 80 on the server. By determining which ports are open on a remote server, we can determine which services are running on that server. A port scanner is a software application designed to probe a server or host for open ports. This is often used by administrators to verify security policies of their networks and by attackers to identify running services on a host with the view to compromise it. </p>
    <p>A port scan or portscan can be defined as a process that sends client requests to a range of server port addresses on a host, with the goal of finding an active port. While not a nefarious process in and of itself, it is one used by hackers to probe target machine services with the aim of exploiting a known vulnerability of that service. However the majority of uses of a port scan are not attacks and are simple probes to determine services available on a remote machine. </p>
    <p>Fingerprinting is a means of ascertaining the operating system of a remote computer on a network. Fingerprinting is more generally used to detect specific versions of applications or protocols that are run on network servers.

    <p>A. A user has plugged in a personal access point at their desk to connect to the network wirelessly. <br/>B. The company is currently experiencing an attack on their internal DNS servers. <br/>C. The company’s WEP encryption has been compromised and WPA2 needs to be implemented instead. <br/>D.

    <div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902H76"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>The question implies that users should be required to enter their domain credentials upon connection to the wireless network. The fact that they are connecting to a wireless network without being prompted for their domain credentials and they are unable to access network resources suggests they are connecting to a rogue wireless network. A rogue access point is a wireless access point that has either been installed on a secure company network without explicit authorization from a local network administrator, or has been created to allow a hacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack. Rogue access points of the first kind can pose a security threat to large organizations with many employees, because anyone with access to the premises can install (maliciously or non-maliciously) an inexpensive wireless router that can potentially allow access to a secure network to unauthorized parties. Rogue access points of the second kind target networks that do not employ mutual authentication (client-server server-client) and may be used in conjunction with a rogue RADIUS server, depending on security configuration of the target network. To prevent the installation of rogue access points, organizations can install wireless intrusion prevention systems to monitor the radio spectrum for unauthorized access points. </p></span> </div>

    <div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902H77"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Separation of duties divides administrator or privileged tasks into separate groupings, which in turn, is individually assigned to unique administrators. This helps in fraud prevention, error reduction, as well as conflict of interest prevention. For example, those who configure security should not be the same people who test security. In this case, Peter should not be allowed to write and sign paycheques. </p></span> </div>

    <div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902H80"><span><b>Answer: A </b>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>A sniffer is another name for a protocol analyzer. A protocol analyzer performs its function in a passive manner. In other words, computers on the network do not know that their data packets have been captured. A Protocol Analyzer is a hardware device or more commonly a software program used to capture network data communications sent between devices on a network. Capturing packets sent from a computer system is known as packet sniffing. Well known software protocol analyzers include Message Analyzer (formerly Network Monitor) from Microsoft and Wireshark (formerly Ethereal). </p>
    <p>A sniffer (packet sniffer) is a tool that intercepts data flowing in a network. If computers are connected to a local area network that is not filtered or switched, the traffic can be broadcast to all computers contained in the same segment. This doesn’t generally occur, since computers are generally told to ignore all the comings and goings of traffic from other computers. However, in the case of a sniffer, all traffic is shared when the sniffer software commands the Network Interface Card (NIC) to stop ignoring the traffic. The NIC is put into promiscuous mode, and it reads communications between computers within a particular segment. This allows the sniffer to seize everything that is flowing in the network, which can lead to the unauthorized access of sensitive data. A packet sniffer can take the form of either a hardware or software solution. A sniffer is also known as a packet analyzer. </p></span> </div>

    <p><b>Suspicious traffic without a specific signature was detected. Under further investigation, it was determined that these were false indicators. Which of the following security devices needs to be configured to disable future false alarms? <br/></b></p>
    <p>A. Signature based IPS <br/>B. Signature based IDS <br/>C. Application based IPS <br/>D. Anomaly based IDS </p>
    <style> .hidden-div{ display:none } </style>
    <p><button onclick="getElementById('hidden-div902H82').style.display = 'block'"> Show Answer </button></p>
    <div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902H82"><span><b>Answer: D </b>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Most intrusion detection systems (IDS) are what is known as signature-based. This means that they operate in much the same way as a virus scanner, by searching for a known identity – or signature – for each specific intrusion event. And, while signature-based IDS is very efficient at sniffing out known s of attack, it does, like anti-virus software, depend on receiving regular signature updates, to keep in touch with variations in hacker technique. In other words, signature-based IDS is only as good as its database of stored signatures. Any organization wanting to implement a more thorough – and hence safer – solution, should consider what we call anomaly-based IDS. By its nature, anomaly-based IDS is a rather more complex creature. In network traffic terms, it captures all the headers of the IP packets running towards the network. From this, it filters out all known and legal traffic, including web traffic to the organization’s web server, mail traffic to and from its mail server, outgoing web traffic from company employees and DNS traffic to and from its DNS server. </p>
    <p>There are other equally obvious advantages to using anomaly-based IDS. For example, because it detects any traffic that is new or unusual, the anomaly method is particularly good at identifying sweeps and probes towards network hardware. It can, therefore, give early warnings of potential intrusions, because probes and scans are the predecessors of all attacks. And this applies equally to any new service installed on any item of hardware – for example, Telnet deployed on a network router for maintenance purposes and forgotten about when the maintenance was finished. This makes anomaly-based IDS perfect for detecting anything from port anomalies and web anomalies to mis-formed attacks, where the URL is deliberately mis-typed. </p></span> </div>

    <p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Load balancing refers to shifting a load from one device to another. A load balancer can be implemented as a software or hardware solution, and it is usually associated with a device—a router, a firewall, NAT appliance, and so on. In its most common implementation, a load balancer splits the traffic intended for a website into individual requests that are then rotated to redundant servers as they become available. </p></span> </div>

    <div "="" class="hidden-div" id="hidden-div902H100"><span><b>Answer: C </b>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>Different services use different ports. When a service is enabled on a computer, a network port is opened for that service. For example, enabling the HTTP service on a web server will open port 80 on the server. By determining which ports are open on a remote server, we can determine which services are running on that server. A port scanner is a software application designed to probe a server or host for open ports. This is often used by administrators to verify security policies of their networks and by attackers to identify running services on a host with the view to compromise it. A port scan or portscan can be defined as a process that sends client requests to a range of server port addresses on a host, with the goal of finding an active port. While not a nefarious process in and of itself, it is one used by hackers to probe target machine services with the aim of exploiting a known vulnerability of that service. However the majority of uses of a port scan are not attacks and are simple probes to determine services available on a remote machine. </p></span> </div>
